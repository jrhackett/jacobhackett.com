                        <p>I am a junior at Worcester Polytechnic Institute studying Robotics Engineering and Computer Science. I will be working at Wakefly for the summer of 2016. As my double major suggests, my interests are quite broad and include any application of robotics, software development, computer security and more.</p>

                                <p>I worked on a team of three to design, build and program a robot to navigate a complex maze that found and extinguished a candle hidden in the maze. The robotic system consisted of an Arduino, VEX robotics parts and custom designed parts and circuits. Although I had a hand in all parts of the process, my main contribution was programming the bulk of our state control and logic.</p>

                                <p>I worked with a small team to create high tech solutions for people with disabilities. The goal of the project was to increase the independence safety of these people while developing a process that our sponsor can use to implement high tech assistive technology in more homes. Seven Hills is working to implement our process in their community homes now.</p>

                                <p>I worked on a small team on a manipulation robot project. The project included working with an ATMEL microcontroller in an embedded system to control a 2D planar robotic arm. The system recognized the existence of blocks on a conveyor belt, picked up the blocks and sorted them based on weight. My main contribution to this project included writing feedback mechanisms in C and working within the embedded system.</p>

                                <p>I worked on a team of nine to create a WPI navigation application. We worked to make an intuitive and well designed app that can take you anywhere on campus. The project was written in Java, used JavaFX for the front end work and the work spanned seven weeks. My primary jobs were to organize our backend into object oriented friendly code, design the entire application and write a lot of front end code. The project can be seen <a href = "https://github.com/jrhackett/cs3733-team9">here</a>.</p>

                                <p>I am currently working on a set of algorithms to trade cryptocurrencies on Poloniex.com. Right now, I can identify and exploit triangular arbitrage opportunities. The script is written in PHP and uses the Poloniex API to access information about the currencies. This project is entirely written and maintained by me.</p>

Right now, I am using Bootstrap to create this responsive website. My main focus now is to improve my Javascript knowledge while maintaining a simple, stylish website.</p>
